# 🔁 The Day I Lost Almost Everything

Today, I lost nearly **everything** I ever coded.  
My WSL environment and all the local code that wasn’t pushed to GitHub — gone.  
**Months** — no — **years** of learning, passion, and grind — just wiped. 💀

This wasn’t just about files. It was about memories, late-night debugging, half-baked dreams, and digital legacies — all erased because of a rogue sync between Windows and WSL using `lsyncd`.

---

## 💥 The Crash

**What went wrong?**

- A bi-directional sync setup misfired.
- No proper, automated backup system.
- No Git version control for most of my projects.
- VS Code and WSL both showed **empty** directories.

That sinking feeling when you open a project folder and see **nothing** — yeah, that one.

At that moment, I knew:

> **Nobody is coming to save my files. I have to rebuild it all.**

## 🛠️ Rebuild Phase 1: Directory Structure

I started by writing a small Python script to recreate a proper folder hierarchy for development:

```plaintext
Development/
├── projects/
│   └── onslaught2342/
├── hugo/
│   └── onslaught-blog/
├── secrets/
├── scripts/
└── backups/
```

Here’s a cleaned-up, properly structured version of your Hugo markdown blog post, preserving your emotion and story, but improving formatting, grammar, and adding some clarity for future readers:

## 🔐 Rebuild Phase 2: GPG Identity

Since I lost my secure environment, I also decided to **recreate my GPG identities** from scratch.

### 🔑 New Keys:

```plaintext
pub   ed25519 2025-07-12 [SC]
      141A91DD0E6EF1FA050C4239D1387C549D47117A
uid           [ultimate] Abdul Nafay <abdulnafay2341@gmail.com>
sub   cv25519 2025-07-12 [E]

pub   ed25519 2025-07-12 [SC]
      B223F1ABA1B79DC9EC7F7D80AA21ACBF89116AF4
uid           [full] Onslaught2342 <onslaught2342@outlook.com>
sub   cv25519 2025-07-12 [E]
```

- Revoked old keys with broken or mismatched UIDs.
- Signed the new key (Onslaught2342) using my real identity (Abdul Nafay).
- Uploaded and synced public keys across major keyservers.

## 📦 What’s Left?

- ✅ Hugo blog works again (at least!)
- ❌ All code outside GitHub is lost
- ⚠️ Some images failed to copy due to encoding errors
- 🧠 My lessons? Burned deep.

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned (the hard way)

- **Automate your backups.** Manual backup ≠ real backup.
- **Treat WSL like production.** Syncing Windows ↔ WSL needs serious caution.

---

This hurt. But it also forced me to rebuild things better — with structure, clarity, and control.

> _It’s not the first time I’ve rebuilt from nothing. But this time, I’m making sure it’s the last._

🛠️ Rebuild continues...
