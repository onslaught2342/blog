# July â†’ August 2025 Update

The past two months have been busy â€” both in school life and my tech journey. Iâ€™ve been juggling coding, schoolwork, and a few personal goals along the way.

## July Highlights

July felt like a month of exploring. I spent most of my free time diving into coding, especially **Python**, and started poking around ethical hacking basics. I updated my GitHub projects, cleaned up my files so I could actually find stuff, and watched a ton of tech videos to try new things.  
Schoolwork was there too, of course â€” I tried to revise more regularly so my grades donâ€™t take a hit.

## August Progress

August turned out to be a lot more eventful. I kept pushing updates to my GitHub, tried **Java** and **Bash**, and learned how to set up **Hugo Extended** for my blog. I also started experimenting with **Docker** and got into some networking stuff like finding the best Wi-Fi channel for stability.

## Todayâ€™s Focus

Today, Iâ€™m aiming for something big â€” trying to go for the **captain position** in my school society. Itâ€™s a mix of excitement and nerves, but Iâ€™m ready to give it my best shot. Whether itâ€™s tech projects or leadership roles, Iâ€™m all in.

## Next Steps

- Keep learning new programming languages and tools.
- Maintain consistency in studies.
- Prepare for more leadership opportunities.
- Keep the blog updated regularly.
