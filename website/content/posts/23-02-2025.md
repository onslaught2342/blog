# Technical Issues and Frustrations

I don't know why, but I've been experiencing a lot of issues with **Obsidian** and **Hugo**. Fixing these issues in Obsidian took a lot of time, and on top of that, I ended up **destroying my GitHub commit history** due to a submodule issue.

Additionally, GitHub Pages was removing the PNG assets, so I had to destroy that setup. Now, I’m using **Cloudflare Pages**, but the assets are still present—just not working. I plan to deploy the site to **Vercel** as well, in hopes that it will work better.

Now, I’m just tired of it all.

it is around 6 and i have fixed most issues with the blog and updated it's domains lets see if it works.

## Music for the Moment

By the way, I’ve also been listening to the song **NEONI - Darkside (Lyrics).mp4** to keep me going through all the frustration.
