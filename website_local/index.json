[{"content":"🔁 The Day I Lost Almost Everything Today, I lost nearly everything I ever coded.\nMy WSL environment and all the local code that wasn’t pushed to GitHub — gone.\nMonths — no — years of learning, passion, and grind — just wiped. 💀\nThis wasn’t just about files. It was about memories, late-night debugging, half-baked dreams, and digital legacies — all erased because of a rogue sync between Windows and WSL using lsyncd.\n💥 The Crash What went wrong?\nA bi-directional sync setup misfired. No proper, automated backup system. No Git version control for most of my projects. VS Code and WSL both showed empty directories. That sinking feeling when you open a project folder and see nothing — yeah, that one.\nAt that moment, I knew:\nNobody is coming to save my files. I have to rebuild it all.\n🛠️ Rebuild Phase 1: Directory Structure I started by writing a small Python script to recreate a proper folder hierarchy for development:\nDevelopment/ ├── projects/ │ └── onslaught2342/ ├── hugo/ │ └── onslaught-blog/ ├── secrets/ ├── scripts/ └── backups/ Here’s a cleaned-up, properly structured version of your Hugo markdown blog post, preserving your emotion and story, but improving formatting, grammar, and adding some clarity for future readers:\n🔐 Rebuild Phase 2: GPG Identity Since I lost my secure environment, I also decided to recreate my GPG identities from scratch.\n🔑 New Keys: pub ed25519 2025-07-12 [SC] 141A91DD0E6EF1FA050C4239D1387C549D47117A uid [ultimate] Abdul Nafay \u0026lt;abdulnafay2341@gmail.com\u0026gt; sub cv25519 2025-07-12 [E] pub ed25519 2025-07-12 [SC] B223F1ABA1B79DC9EC7F7D80AA21ACBF89116AF4 uid [full] Onslaught2342 \u0026lt;onslaught2342@outlook.com\u0026gt; sub cv25519 2025-07-12 [E] Revoked old keys with broken or mismatched UIDs. Signed the new key (Onslaught2342) using my real identity (Abdul Nafay). Uploaded and synced public keys across major keyservers. 📦 What’s Left? ✅ Hugo blog works again (at least!) ❌ All code outside GitHub is lost ⚠️ Some images failed to copy due to encoding errors 🧠 My lessons? Burned deep. 📚 Lessons Learned (the hard way) Automate your backups. Manual backup ≠ real backup. Treat WSL like production. Syncing Windows ↔ WSL needs serious caution. This hurt. But it also forced me to rebuild things better — with structure, clarity, and control.\nIt’s not the first time I’ve rebuilt from nothing. But this time, I’m making sure it’s the last.\n🛠️ Rebuild continues\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"http://127.0.0.1:5500/posts/2025-07-12/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"-the-day-i-lost-almost-everything\"\u003e🔁 The Day I Lost Almost Everything\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, I lost nearly \u003cstrong\u003eeverything\u003c/strong\u003e I ever coded.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy WSL environment and all the local code that wasn’t pushed to GitHub — gone.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMonths\u003c/strong\u003e — no — \u003cstrong\u003eyears\u003c/strong\u003e of learning, passion, and grind — just wiped. 💀\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn’t just about files.

In this post, I’ll share my experience obtaining an S/MIME certificate from Actalis, publishing my PGP key to a keyserver, and setting up a Keybase account for cryptographic identity verification.\nIssuing an S/MIME Certificate from Actalis S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) allows me to encrypt and digitally sign my emails. I decided to get a free personal S/MIME certificate from Actalis to improve my email security.\nHow I Got My Actalis S/MIME Certificate: Visited Actalis: I went to Actalis\u0026rsquo; website and found their free S/MIME certificate section. Registered for a Certificate: I entered my email address and followed the instructions. Verified My Email: Actalis sent me a confirmation email, which I had to click to proceed. Downloaded and Installed the Certificate: After issuance, I downloaded the .p12 certificate and installed it in my email client (Thunderbird, Outlook). Configured My Email Client: I imported the certificate and enabled digital signing and encryption for outgoing emails. Publishing My PGP Key to a Keyserver PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is another way to encrypt and sign emails. I wanted to make my public PGP key available so that others could verify my emails and send me encrypted messages.\nSteps I Took to Generate and Publish My PGP Key: Generated a PGP Key:\ngpg --full-generate-key I selected RSA (4096-bit recommended). Set an expiration date (or chose no expiration). Entered my name, email, and a strong passphrase. Exported My Public Key:\ngpg --armor --export MY_EMAIL \u0026gt; mykey.asc Published It to a Keyserver:\ngpg --send-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com MY_KEY_ID I replaced MY_KEY_ID with my actual key fingerprint (I found it using gpg --list-keys).\nVerified the Upload: I searched for my email on Ubuntu’s Keyserver and confirmed that my key was publicly available.\nSetting Up My Keybase Account Keybase is a great platform for verifying identities and securely sharing cryptographic keys. I wanted to establish my online identity and link my cryptographic credentials in one place.\nSteps I Took to Set Up Keybase: Signed Up: I created an account on Keybase.io. Verified My Online Identities: I linked my GitHub, Twitter, and other accounts to prove my identity. Imported My PGP Key: I went to my profile settings. Selected “PGP Keys” and uploaded my public key. Used Keybase for Secure Messaging: I explored Keybase’s encrypted messaging, file sharing, and team collaboration features. Conclusion By obtaining an S/MIME certificate, publishing my PGP key, and setting up Keybase, I’ve taken important steps toward improving my email security and online identity verification. These tools make encryption practical and accessible, allowing me to communicate more securely.\n","permalink":"http://127.0.0.1:5500/posts/2025-03-16/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"my-experience-with-issuing-an-smime-certificate-publishing-pgp-keys-and-setting-up-keybase\"\u003eMy Experience with Issuing an S/MIME Certificate, Publishing PGP Keys, and Setting Up Keybase\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecuring my email communication has been an important step in my tech journey.
